=====================================================================

FlatCAM is a program for preparing CNC jobs for making PCBs on a CNC router.
Among other things, it can take a Gerber file generated by your favorite PCB
CAD program, and create G-Code for Isolation routing.

=====================================================================

-------------------------- Installation instructions ----------------

Works with Python version 3.13 and PyQt6.


- Make sure that your OS is up-to-date
- Clone the repo
``` 
git clone https://github.com/Mr-TopG/flatcam-Arch.git
```

**************************************************************************
1.Windows
**************************************************************************
- download the provided installer (for your OS flavor 64bit or 32bit) from:
https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam/downloads/
- execute the installer and install the program. It is recommended to install as a Local User.

or from sources:
- download the sources from the same location
- unzip them on a safe location on your HDD that your user has permissions for
- install WinPython e.g. WinPython 3.9 downloaded from here: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/winpython/files/WinPython_3.9/
Use one of the versions (64bit or 32it) that are compatible with your OS. 
To save space use one of the versions that have the smaller size (they offer 2 versions: 
one with size of few hundred MB and one smaller with size of few tens of MB)

- add Python folder and Python\Scripts folder to your Windows Path 
- (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v%3Doffice.14))
- verify that the pip package can be run by opening Command Prompt(Admin) and running the command:
```
pip -V
```

- look in the requirements.txt file (found in the sources folder) and install all the dependencies using 
the pip package. 
The required wheels can be downloaded either from:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ (Recommended)
or if the required modules cannot be found in the previous source use:
https://pypi.org/
 
You can download all the required wheels files into a folder (e.g D:\my_folder) and install them from 
Command Prompt like this:

```
cd D:\my_folder
```

and for each wheel file (*.whl) run:
```
D:\my_folder\> pip install --upgrade package_from_requirements.whl
```

Run FlatCAM beta from the installation folder (e.g D:\FlatCAM_beta) in the Command Prompt with the following command:
cd D:\FlatCAM_beta
python FlatCAM.py

**************************************************************************
2.Linux
**************************************************************************


- make sure that Python 3.13 is installed on your OS: 
```
python --version
```
- verify that the pip package is installed for your Python installation (e.g 25.0.1) by running the command:
```
pip --version
``` 

If it is not installed, install it. In Ubuntu-like OS's it is done like this: 
```
sudo pacman -S python python-pip 
```


- Make the setup.sh executable and run it
```
chmod +x setup.sh; ./setup.sh
```

- if the previous command is successful and has no errors, run FlatCAM with the command: python FlatCAM.py

- Alternatively you can install it on Ubuntu with:
```
# Optional if depencencies are missing
make install_dependencies

# Install for the current user only (using the folder in its place)
make install

# System-wide instalation
sudo make install
```

3.MacOS

Instructions from here: https://gist.github.com/natevw/3e6fc929aff358b38c0a#gistcomment-3111878

- create a folder to hold the sources somewhere on your HDD:
mkdir FlatCAM-beta

- unzip in this folder the sources downloaded from https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam/downloads/
Using commands (e.g using the sources for FlatCAM beta 8.995):
cd ~/FlatCAM-beta
wget https://bitbucket.org/jpcgt/flatcam/downloads/FlatCAM_beta_8.995_sources.zip
unzip FlatCAM_beta_8.995_sources.zip
cd FlatCAM_beta_8.995_sources

- check if Homebrew is installed:
xcode-select --install
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

- install dependencies:
brew install pyqt
brew install gdal
python3 -m ensurepip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

- run FlatCAM
python3 FlatCAM.py
